Due to the limitation of uploading data size, there is no way to upload all the simulation data, 
here we upload a set of simulation data files of 1‚úñÔ∏è on a single chromosome, and provide the generation method and code as follows, 
another reader who needs all the files can write an email to the following mailbox to apply for providing.

Different read-pair depth simulation data generation methods:

  python wangshj**.py

For example, if you need to generate simulation data for chromosome 1 with 1x read depth,
run chr1.sh in the environment where GSDcreator is installed.

GSDcreator can be downloaded from the link below and be installed followed by the readme file.
