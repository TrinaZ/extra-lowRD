Due to the limitation of uploading data size, there is no way to upload all the simulation data, 
here we upload a set of simulation data files of 1‚úñÔ∏è on a single chromosome, and provide the generation method and code as follows, 
another reader who needs all the files can write an email to the following mailbox to apply for providing.

üìßÔºözt12389@stu.xjtu.edu.cn

Different read-pair depth simulation data generation methods:

  python wangshj**.py

For example, if you need to generate simulation data for chromosome 1 with 1x read depth,
run chr1.sh in the environment where GSDcreator is installed.
